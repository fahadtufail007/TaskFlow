The "additionalProperties": false attribute in a JSON schema specifies that no additional properties (other than the ones defined in the schema) are allowed in the JSON object being validated. In other words, it restricts the object to only have the properties listed under the "properties" attribute in the schema.

In a JSON schema, the title attribute is used to provide a short, human-readable description or title for the schema.
