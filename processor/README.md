# Task Processor

Information for the Processor is held in the task.processor object.

The Processor strips the task.hub object before forwarding to a Task Function.

The Task Function mainly communicates with the Task Processor using the object task.processor which includes fields: command, commandArgs, config. The Task Processor can use language specific side-channels to communicate with the Tsak Function e.g., events, callbacks, promises, etc. The principle is that the Task Function is implemented for each environment raher than being agnostic, the JSON schema of the Task allows for synchronizatsion across environments.

task.processor.command maybe be one of 
  * partial
  * update
  * start
  * next
## Future
Hub functionality that can be pushed to the Processor should be pushed to the processor e.g.,
* Filter execution
* Diff generation
* Template filling
* Throttling

 We want a notion of a Task event. For example, React could be sensitive to changes in the Task. The taskChange is the event. These can be numbered if w√© need to ensure the event is processed once (the effect may be sensitive to other signals). It would be possible to use Javascript events to in the case of React so we can ensure delivery and consumption. The processor can provide event filtering so effects are insensitive to the order of events e.g., taskEvent("a && b") 

```javascript
// The expression will evaluate to true upon the event that completes the expression
// taskChange should be an event that holds the latest updates to the Task
// We should wrap taskEvent with a higher order function createTaskEvent then user only need call taskEvent without needing to pass in taskChnage and task each time. 
function taskEvent(expression, taskChange, task) {
    // Use exprima to get the AST for expression
    // for each variable in the expression rewrite the expresion where that variable is refered to as taskChange.variable while the other variables are task.variable
    // Build modifiedExpression as a logical OR of all these expression rewrites
    // Wee are returning the math.evaluate it should be evaluated in the context of where the function was called
    // mathjs is safer than using eval, it suports AND not && (etc) but we can rewrite && as AND during the rewrite step above.
    // return math.evaluate(modifiedExpression, {taskChange, task}) 
}
```
